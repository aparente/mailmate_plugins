-- Create a note using the Quick Entry view. When the view is closed, focus is returned to MailMate.
-- A previous version of this used `system attribute` to pass values, but it appears to have non-solveable UTF8 issues.

-- ToDo:
--  What about other properties (project, context, ...)

on run argv
	set theFilename to item 1 of argv
	set theName to do shell script "head -n1 " & theFilename
	set theNote to do shell script "tail -n+2 " & theFilename

	tell application "OmniFocus"
		tell default document
			tell quick entry
				set theTask to make new inbox task with properties {name:theName, note:theNote}
				select {theTask}
				set note expanded of tree 1 to true
				open
				tell application "System Events" to keystroke tab
			end tell
		end tell
	end tell
end run

-- The following might be useful alternative approaches:
-- 
-- Create a note without activating OmniFocus or opening the Quick Entry view.
-- tell application "OmniFocus"
-- 	tell default document
-- 		make new inbox task with properties {name:theName, note:theNote}
-- 	end tell
-- end tell
-- 
-- END
-- 
-- Create a note using the `omnifocus:` URL scheme. Leaves OmniFocus in an activated state.
--  Note: Could not find documentation for the omnifocus: URL scheme. What is possible?
-- /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby -wKU

-- require 'uri'
-- system ("open", "omnifocus:///add?name=" + URI::escape(ENV["MM_NAME"]) + "&note=Email:%20message://%253c" + URI::escape(ENV["MM_MESSAGE_ID"]) + "%253e")
